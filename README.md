# Note Manager

Note manager is an application to take organised notes quickly and efficiently. Notes are organised in different folders and can be sorted by date added, date modified, or alphabetically. Notes can also be protected by a password.

Students and professionals alike take notes for various reasons. This application will be useful for most people.

I have used a variety of note taking applications but all of them lacked some features that I wanted. To address that, I decided to create my own note manager! 

The application is made using Java and therefore runs on all platforms that support Java. Some of them are:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
